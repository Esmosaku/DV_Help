## Code2040 Hackathon Team 26
A discreet domestic violence support app built for safety, accessibility and trust. 
This is a mobile app prototype disguised as a calculator.

## Inspiration
For decades, the default response to domestic violence in the U.S. has been "call the police."
But for many people, especially People of Color, immigrants, and undocumented survivors, involving law enforcement can increase danger rather than reduce it.

This project was created to explore alternative, survivor-centered pathways to safety that:
- Do not immediately involve law enforcement
- Are discreet and hard to detect by an abuser
- Provide resources, planning, and information in a safe way

## Features
### Calculator Interface
- Functions like a normal calculator
- Entering a specific code (2 + 0 + 4 + 0) unlocks the app

### Dashboard
- Entry point to safety planning and resources

### Shelter and Resource Information
- Domestic violence shelters and hotlines (starting with Seattle & Los Angeles)

### Plan Page
- Helps users think through next steps safely

## Tech Stack
- React Native
- Expo
- JavaScript
- Typescript
- Figma (UI/UX design)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Xcode (for iOS simulator) or Expo Go app

### Installation
```bash
